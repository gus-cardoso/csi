    <h1>Project 1</h1>
    
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>Project Requirements include:<br>
        1. Include at least one heading (h1, h2, etc.) in your web page.<br>
        2. Display a code fragment from the program, or display the whole program, if appropriate. Feel free to create the program yourself or use a program that you find in a book or on the Internet.<br>
        3. Refer to a specific variable in the program, specific input, and specific output.<br>
        4. Provide a quote from a book that refers to the program or to a concept illustrated by the program, and provide a citation for the book’s title. Feel free to use a real quote from a real book or make up a fictional quote from a fictional book.<br>
        5. Provide an acronym (real or made up) or a definition that somehow relates to the web page’s discussion.<br> 
        6. Include a total of at least 5 different types of phrasing elements in your web page. You must use appropriate phrasing elements that fit the flow of your web page. You will lose points if any of your elements are inappropriate (e.g., using wbr in a normal-length word). For future projects, you will use CSS for formatting. But for practice purposes, for this project, use only HTML5 elements and not CSS.<br>
